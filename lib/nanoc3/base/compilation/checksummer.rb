module Nanoc3

  # Responsible for creating checksums of files. Such checksums are used to
  # determine whether files have changed between compilations.
  #
  # Identical content will always result in the same checksum. Multiple
  # invocations of the checksum creation methods with the same content or
  # filename will yield the same result.
  #
  # The returned checksum has the property that for two given files with
  # different content, the returned checksum will be different with a very
  # high probability. In practice, this boils down to using a secure
  # cryptographic hash function, such as SHA-1.
  #
  # The format of the resulting checksum should not be relied upon. In future
  # versions of nanoc, this function may use a different method for generating
  # checksums.
