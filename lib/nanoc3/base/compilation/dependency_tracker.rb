module Nanoc3

  # Responsible for remembering dependencies between items and layouts. It is
  # used to speed up compilation by only letting an item be recompiled when it
  # is outdated or any of its dependencies (or dependencies’ dependencies,
  # etc) is outdated.
  #
  # The dependencies tracked by the dependency tracker are not dependencies
  # based on an item’s or a layout’s content. When one object uses an
  # attribute of another object, then this is also treated as a dependency.
  # While dependencies based on an item’s or layout’s content (handled in
  # {Nanoc3::Compiler}) cannot be mutually recursive, the more general
  # dependencies in Nanoc3::DependencyTracker can (e.g. item A can use an
  # attribute of item B and vice versa without problems).
  #
  # The dependency tracker remembers the dependency information between runs.
  # Dependency information is stored in the `tmp/dependencies` file. This file
  # also contains a version number; when a dependencies file with an
  # incompatible version is found, it is ignored.
